## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes several core features that replicate real-world booking platform functionality.  
Each feature plays a critical role in delivering a complete user experience while showcasing backend architecture, database design, and API integration.  

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.  
It supports different roles (e.g., hosts and guests) and ensures authentication and authorization through secure API endpoints.  

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can list, update, and remove properties on the platform.  
Each property includes essential details like title, description, location, pricing, and availability, making it easier for guests to browse and book.  

### 3. Booking System
Guests can book properties for specific dates while the system checks availability and prevents conflicts.  
This feature ensures smooth reservation workflows and maintains booking records tied to both users and properties.  

### 4. Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties after completing their stays.  
This promotes trust and transparency within the platform while helping future guests make informed decisions.  

### 5. Payment Integration
A secure payment system is linked to bookings, allowing users to complete transactions.  
It tracks payment status (pending, completed, failed) to ensure financial accountability within the application.  

### 6. API Security
The project implements security measures such as authentication tokens, role-based access, and input validation.  
These safeguards ensure that sensitive data, bookings, and financial transactions remain protected.  

### 7. CI/CD Integration
With GitHub Actions (or similar tools), the project features automated pipelines for building, testing, and deployment.  
This improves efficiency, reduces manual errors, and mirrors modern industry workflows.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The database is designed using a **relational model** to represent users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.  
This structure ensures scalability, data integrity, and efficient queries.  

### Key Entities

1. **Users**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `password`
   - `role` (e.g., host, guest)
   - **Relationships**:  
     - A user can list multiple properties.  
     - A user can make multiple bookings.  
     - A user can leave multiple reviews.  

2. **Properties**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `location`
   - `price_per_night`
   - `host_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)  
   - **Relationships**:  
     - A property belongs to a host (user).  
     - A property can have multiple bookings.  
     - A property can have multiple reviews.  

3. **Bookings**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)  
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)  
   - `check_in_date`
   - `check_out_date`
   - `status` (e.g., pending, confirmed, canceled)  
   - **Relationships**:  
     - A booking belongs to a property.  
     - A booking is made by a user.  
     - A booking is associated with a payment.  

4. **Reviews**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)  
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)  
   - `rating` (1‚Äì5 stars)
   - `comment`
   - **Relationships**:  
     - A review belongs to a property.  
     - A review is written by a user.  

5. **Payments**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `booking_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Bookings)  
   - `amount`

### Entity Relationships Summary
- A **User** can be a host (owning properties) or a guest (making bookings).  
- A **Property** belongs to a host and can receive multiple bookings and reviews.  
- A **Booking** is made by a user for a property and is tied to a payment.  
- A **Review** links a user to a property with feedback.  
- A **Payment** ensures financial transactions are recorded for bookings.

## üîí API Security

Security is a critical component of the Airbnb Clone project, ensuring that user data, transactions, and system operations are safeguarded against threats.  
The following key measures are implemented to protect the backend APIs:  

### 1. Authentication
- **What it does**: Ensures that only verified users can access the system by requiring secure login credentials and issuing authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).  
- **Why it‚Äôs important**: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and ensures that sensitive information like personal details and bookings remain private.  

### 2. Authorization
- **What it does**: Restricts access to resources based on user roles (e.g., host vs. guest).  
- **Why it‚Äôs important**: Prevents users from performing unauthorized actions, such as a guest trying to delete a property they don‚Äôt own.  

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **What it does**: Controls the number of API requests a client can make within a given timeframe.  
- **Why it‚Äôs important**: Protects the system from abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and ensures fair usage among all users.  

### 4. Input Validation & Data Sanitization
- **What it does**: Validates and cleanses incoming data before processing it in the system.  
- **Why it‚Äôs important**: Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and corrupted data being stored in the database.  

### 5. Secure Payments Handling
- **What it does**: Encrypts and secures financial transactions linked to bookings.  
- **Why it‚Äôs important**: Ensures payment integrity, prevents fraud, and protects users‚Äô financial details.  

---

By combining these measures, the project maintains a secure environment for **users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments**, aligning with industry best practices for scalable applications.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying applications.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that code changes from multiple contributors are integrated, tested, and validated frequently.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the release process, pushing code changes to production or staging environments quickly and reliably.  

### Why It‚Äôs Important
- **Faster Development Cycles**: Automates testing and deployment, reducing manual errors and speeding up releases.  
- **Improved Code Quality**: Ensures that every commit is tested before being merged.  
- **Consistency**: Provides a standardized process for building and deploying across environments.  
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to manage large projects with multiple contributors.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating builds, running tests, and deploying the project directly from the repository.  
- **Docker**: To containerize the application, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  
- **Optional Tools**: Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI could also be used depending on project needs.

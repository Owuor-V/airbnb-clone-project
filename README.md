## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project leverages modern technologies to build a scalable and secure booking platform.  
Below is a breakdown of each technology and its role in the project:  

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend, handle business logic, and expose RESTful APIs.  
- **MySQL**: A relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as users, bookings, and listings.  
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that enables efficient data fetching and allows clients to request exactly the data they need.  
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that ensures consistent application environments across development, testing, and production.  
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools for managing project code, team workflows, and documentation.  
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool for automating testing, building, and deployment pipelines.  

Each of these technologies contributes to creating a robust, secure, and collaborative development environment, mirroring real-world industry practices.
